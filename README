in this project I've executed the game "four in a row".
the class Game is responsible for the game logic:
- contains a 2 dimensional list to represent the game board.
- updating moves in  board.
- giving the game state - who wins draw or nothing special.
- getting the current player.
- getting value for specific row and column.

the class MyBoard in "four in a row.py" initializes and creates an instance
of game as server or client, with gui and communication support, according to
the input from the user (ip,port,player type).
in this class also the logic of the game is reflected.

the class Ai is responsible for making random move for Ai player.
